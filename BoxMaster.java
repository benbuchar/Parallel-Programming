     * The BoxMaster's recursive decomposition algorithm.
     * The BoxMaster looks N-moves ahead in the state of the game
     * and returns a list of the moves it believes are best for each
     * turn.
     *
     * N is defined by the depth field in the BoxMaster constructor.
     *
     * For each available move that can be made, the BoxMaster copies the given
     * state of the game and makes the move on the copy. It then creates a
     * BoxMaster child who is given the new state.
     *
     * In parallel, each BoxMaster will make moves on their states and make children
     * who are given the new states. When a child receives a state with only 1 move
     * left in the game, or the child's depth is specified as 1, it will sequentially
     * determine the best move it can make on the given state.
     *
     * Upon joining from all children, a BoxMaster will choose which ArrayList of
     * moves it has received is the best move list, and return that back up to its parent.
     *
     * @return an ArrayList containing the moves which the BoxMaster and its children
     *  believe will result in the best score for Player 2 if executed in order.
     *  Number of turns evaluated is equal to the depth specified.
